### **Project Goals**
*Body's Intention* is a fitness oriented site with the intentions
as the name suggests, to provide users with the platform to not
only have the ability to purchase for relevant products, but also inquire about them. 
Anyone who cares about their body will find this site caterd to 
their needs.

### **User Stories**

As an **aspiring** and **already** fitness oriented individual, I would want:

1. To easily be able to purchase products.
2. To be able to inquire about my wonderings.
3. To have my own profile in which I interact with the site.
